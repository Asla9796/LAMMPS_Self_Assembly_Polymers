## Evaporation induced self assembly of nanoparticles
- Molecular dynamics simulation of self assembly of nanoparticles driven by evaporation
- Fabrication of ultra-thin films of nanoparticles is of critical importance for the manufacture of sensors, optical devices and magnetic storage media. One common method to prepare thin films of nanoparticles is by suspending them in a solution and evaporating the solvent off a substrate. The factors that influence the structure formed is dependant on the evaporation dynamics of the solvent including volatility/equilibrium vapour pressure, solvent-nanoparticle interaction, nanoparticle-nanoparticle interaction, concentration of nanoparticles in the solution etc. This study tries to replicate the work done by Cheng, Grest and et.al., on the evaporation of
Lennard-Jones fluids and subsequently induced nanoparticle assembly, in a model system.
